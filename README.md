Campus-E-Wallet-System

The Campus E-Wallet System is a digital financial management tool designed for students and campus organizations. It provides a secure and convenient way to handle transactions, manage funds, and streamline payments within the campus community, reducing the need for cash handling and manual record-keeping.

The system allows students to manage their wallets, send money, view and pay organizational bills, request and track cash-ins, and review transaction history. Students with special roles (like treasurers) also have an organization wallet to post bills, request cash-outs, and manage organization transactions. Finance admins can create accounts, approve or decline cash-in and cash-out requests, and view transaction histories for all accounts.
